        "Unlike most people nowadays, I had no idea about it until I was introduced to the field as an intern at Entrepreneurs RoundTable Accelerator and PCB:NG, the summer of 2017. My amazing bosses, Jonathan and Peter, were very interested in my personal and professional growth and wanted to make sure I was very much a part of the team. Unfortunately, I was unfamiliar with almost all of the core technology stack of the company and since Python was the only language out of the stack I knew, I was given a data analysis project and since then I developed an interest in data science and practically wrote all my Python code in Jupyter Notebooks.\n",

I became so encapsulated in data science and machine learning that my social media feed, Google search history, YouTube video recommendations all became about data science and machine learning at a point.\n",

        "At that time, I had begun creating content on LinkedIn and seeing a lot of advice on how to increase engagement on LinkedIn. For example, some people stated the best times to post to be on Tuesdays at 11 am. Some people said things like 'posts with pictures got the most engagement.' Others stated that tagging famous people in posts got a lot more views and creating video content was better than articles. As much as these pieces of advice were coming from a good place, none of it seemed to be based on data but more based on opinions and experience. And as a person who is data-driven, I decided to work on a project that analyzed the data of my LinkedIn content in order to provide insights.\n",
